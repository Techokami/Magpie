connectors only:

right click -> connect to

left click other end of connector to open modal
	modal asks you to pick which connector was used
		if simple, hit a button that says so to skip the rest of the modal
	also list all elligible connectors, filtered in real time as obstacles get checked
	click on a connector to move to detail view in modal
		check off everything you couldn't get to (checks, entrances), hit done
	map both selected ends to the chosen connector, mark any unchecked checks as checked

improvements:
	+filter out exhausted connectors
	+prevent selecting more anything other than exactly two entrances
	+filter out entrances if requirements must have been met for connection to be made
	+put icons on linked entrances
	+put one way icons on appropriate entrances
	+add dead end version of modal
	+rephrase modal to match new intentions
	fix check distribution
	+fix mark as useless on mapped connector
	+automatically add to three way if one half of connection is already in it, skip modal
	+convert dead end to connection if two+ ends found
	show interior of connector on hover if not simple
	+hide landfill connectors
	show a 'via' in tooltip if three way
	maybe some indicator that there's an unmapped entrance in a mapped three way?
	+richard's connector enters in his actual house
	+in entrance connector line mode, revert icons to regular entrance icon
	+cut out the check selection, just leave them unchecked
	+test and fix three way clear mapping
	+make three ways smarter - detect which entrances should be being connected, remove the choice
	+handle three ways
		+just detect when a new connection is happening with an entrance that's already connected

#left click other end of connector for a simple connection
#right click other end -> pick connector:
   #modal opens, asks what obstacles are left (sword, boots, etc.)
   #also list all elligible connectors below, filtered in real time as obstacles get checked
   #click on a connector to move to detail view in modal
      #check off everything you couldn't get to (checks, entrances), hit done
   
   #map both selected ends to the chosen connector, mark any unchecked checks as checked



use entranceMap to directly map exteriors together? no

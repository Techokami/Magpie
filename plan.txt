set state
  - read tracker status from save game
  - investigate how emulators do it
  - read flags from rom - needs help from daid to embed them in the first place
    - alternative - read flags from URL
  - starting location
  - dungeon shuffle
    - use tracker entrance population to set up ladxr's world_setup
  - boss/miniboss shuffle
  - read bingo board!
  - bonus: read sprite sheet
  
local vs web
  - can the web monitor files (yes), read RAM (no, but a local application can talk to the webapp over websockets)

ladxr
  + get list of possible items given flags
  + get list of flags and their valid values
  + get list of all checks given flags, in logic or not
  ER
    - same as dungeon shuffle - let the user tell us how things connect, we pass that along to ladxr

frontend
  items
    - page load gets items in pool and their max values from LADX - increment/decrement always wraps
    - custom entries allowed e.g. for opened chests
    - HTML template for the overall layout
      - each item is a partial with variables passed to it
        - javascript function for left and right click (e.g. increment('BLUE_TUNIC')/increment('RED_TUNIC'))
        - how to handle images?
    - need to designate a div for unknown items
  maps
    - overworld, dungeons split into tabs
    - define maps and their checks in javascript file, programmatically add them to page
    - update check div's class depeding on availability/checked
    - need to designate a div for unknown checks
  args
    - group args in ladxr's code
    - display args in a little pullout drawer
    - visually group args based on ladxr's groups
    - add a blacklist based on both group and individual
